<h1 align="center"> International Restaurant DBMS Project Abstract <br> CSC4402-Spring23</h1>

<p> The goal of our project is to create an ‘Around the World’ themed restaurant Database Management System (DBMS) that will help simplify and streamline the manager’s inventory management and have a centralized place for customer interactions with the application. This DBMS will be a web-based application, created using React and MySQL, that has a customer and inventory manager view. While there are other DMBS that can maintain inventory, our DBMS will update inventory in real time when items are out of stock or if a customer adds the last available item to their cart. </p>
 <br>
<p>
  The database will consist of a <strong><em><ins>cuisine table</ins></em></strong> which will hold the list of cuisines that the customer will be able to interact with and filter based on dietary preferences. The <strong><em><ins>order-cart table</ins></em></strong> will be used by the customer to add items they would like to order or delete items that they no longer want. The <strong><em><ins>inventory table</ins></em></strong> will be used by the inventory manager to add and remove quantities of foods based on the amount of ingredients sold to the customer.
