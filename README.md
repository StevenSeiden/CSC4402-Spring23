<h1 style="align:center"> Bytes Abroad Project Abstract <br> CSC4402-Spring23</h1>

<p> Our project is an ‘Around the World’ themed restaurant using a Database Management System (DBMS) that will help simplify and streamline the manager’s inventory management and have a centralized place for customer interactions with the application. This DBMS is a web-based application, created primarily using PHP (with Bootstrap) and mySQL, that has a home, menu, cart, and restock page. While there are other DBMS that can maintain inventory, our DBMS can update inventory in real time when items are out of stock or if a customer adds the last available item to their cart.
</p>
 <br>
<p>
  The database will consist of a <strong><em><ins>cuisine table</ins></em></strong> which will hold the list of cuisines that the customer will be able to interact with and filter based on dietary preferences. The <strong><em><ins>order-cart table</ins></em></strong> will be used by the customer to add items they would like to order or delete items that they no longer want. The <strong><em><ins>inventory table</ins></em></strong> will be used by the inventory manager to add and remove quantities of foods based on the amount of ingredients sold to the customer.
